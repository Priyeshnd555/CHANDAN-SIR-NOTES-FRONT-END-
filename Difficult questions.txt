1) how to eliminate duplicate elements from Array..? set constructior i think search anwer

2) why & how  to use throw keyword....?

3)  find the second largest answer without Sorting and swapping also  ? 
	
	 take 2 varialbles 1.largest 2. second largest , and take a for loop and if check if any no is greater than 
	largest change largest to that no .. and change the value of second largest to largest since value of largest is changed 
	

4) how to give alias name while destructuring objects.?	

6)what is rest api..? making http calls is called rest api i think so 

7) what  is the diff between framework and library .?



	javascript is a -> language


	library -> there are no predifined things to develop web apps  they are very light weight around 1lakh code
		-> import install and use
	
	Framework -> it willl have all the neciessity things needed for developing web app available inside it  only somethings are aquired from backend
			there will be around 20 lakh codes approximately  
			->> import and use
 

8) how many of you went to stack overflow home page..?


9) what is diffing algorithm in React...? 

10) what is Time complexity and Space complexity . in algorithm........?? Note : now days we dont worry about space..

11) what is algorithm .....? 

12 ) why bubble sort is the worst sorting mechanism ... because it compares all elements ...?
	
	-> write atleast ,   Merge sort 




IM Q : 9) explain single page and multiple page application what is the difference   if the website gets refreshes then is it 


	single page : -> Gmail  bootstrap ( reason : while using the applicaiton it does not gets Refreshed )
			
		 	warning : if we press the refresh button it will refreshes .... spa also refreshes


	multipage : -> stack over flow , bootstrap ( reason : while using the application it gets refreshes )

		
		-> We can also develop multi page applications using react js 
                NOTE 	=> we use Routing to make our application single page ,

	
	
			
		

10) what is CDN  Explain..? 

	ans : Content Delivery Network 


11) what is min.css..?

	-> we use minified version to Reduce the Loading Time..

	-> there will be less lines of codes  ( there are many online tools available also in js also ) 
	->removes all the white spaces from the css files minified version of css file 


12)  Why react why not Angular or React ...?

			------------------------------------------------------------
		React   --> Only React Has  ( virtural Dom ) / React Dom
			----------------------------------------------------------------
		           -> very less learning Curve 
		          -> based on javascript  
		          -> it has high demand in the market 
		          -> Third party libraries  ( it is both advantages and disadvantage )


		         
13) can we pass state from one component to another..?

             -->no we but we can pass the data as props like title={this.state.text}
	
	-->this is because [ props are immutable ]

	-->we cannot change the state of parent from child 

	-->we have to write a callback func to change the state form child in parent useing [ child->parent ] communication

	-->state can be mutate in the same component only 
  

	-> state data can be passed to child Only  Props since they are immutable in child component
	
	-> it takes a callback funciton in setState

	-> setState is asynchronous


	
14) what are the difference between Props and State 3 must ..? 	
		
	
	-> states are Locally scoped 

	--> setState is Asynchronous  ( is a Web Api ) -> over come we give a second para as callback func 

	-> the second para executes only after setState is updated 

	-> they can only be passed as Props as Other Components as Props are Immutable 



15) explain render() method.?
	
	this is mainly for the view part we should not update the state inside it as it will create infinite 

	since setState will ReRender whenever state Gets updated




16)  Explain Mounting phase ..? 

	the component is completely rendered and is updated in the REAL DOM 

	or Component is Mounted in the Real DOM 	

	-> we shouldnt make api calls here since if render method gets failed then there will be no 
		use of the data that is fetched 



17) what are side Effects...?

	sideEffects : it is nothing but making api calls


	

15) why when we reassign the state instead of using setState the value is not visible in UI but 

		though the value of state variable is updated...?

	---->>ans : the update phase wont get claled since setState is not called so it wont rerender  the ui so

	value wont be reflected in the UI 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16) why component did Update not used carefully Results in  Infinite Loop.....? 


17) why constructor is used ..?

	-> to bind 
	-> to initalize state 

	if above functions are not done then Constructor is not required
